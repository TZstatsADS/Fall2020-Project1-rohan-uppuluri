### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Project title: How Low Income White Americans Vote
+ This project is conducted by Rohan Uppuluri

+ Project summary: The Republican Party supports the idea that the government should play a smaller role in people's lives, especially in the economy. On the other hand, the Democratic party supports the idea of a larger government that is more involved in helping people's everyday lives. Because the Democratic Party favor government aid programs like welfare, in theory it would make sense for more low income voters to vote for the Democratic Party than the Republican Party. I will examine the voting behavior of low income, specifically white Americans, to see if this idea holds. In particular, I hope to answer the following questions:
  + What is the presidential voting behavior of low income white Americans?
  + What are some of the demographic differences between low income white Democrats and low income white Republicans that could help explain their different voting behavior?
